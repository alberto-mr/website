Our paper "Achieving Digital Wellbeing Through Digital Self-Control Tools: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis" has been accepted to [ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction (TOCHI)](https://dl.acm.org/journal/tiis)!
<br><br>
The paper reports on the results of a systematic review and meta-analysis from the computing and HCI literature of current work discussing and/or proposing tools for digital self-control (DSCTs). The work shows that DSCTs target different aspects of people's digital wellbeing, from reducing digital overuse, distractions, and dark patterns to improving the quality of the interaction, e.g., in terms of meaningfulness. At the same time, our analysis also highlights three main important gaps in the current literature on DSCTs: 
<ul>
<li>as in other behavior change domains, research on digital self-control tools suffers from a theoretical gap;</li>
<li>evaluation of DSCTs is nearly always based on short-term experiments that lack important methodological aspects like control groups and follow-up assessments;</li>
<li>there is limited interest in reporting ethical considerations in papers describing DSCTs.</li> 
</ul>
