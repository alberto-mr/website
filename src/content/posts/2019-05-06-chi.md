<p>
On May 6, 2019, I presented the paper "The Race Towards Digital Wellbeing: Issues and Opportunities" at ACM CHI 2019 (International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems), held in Glasgow, UK.
<br><br>
The paper provides a comprehensive perspective on contemporary mobile apps designed to address "smartphone addiction" and promote "digital wellbeing." It presents a functionality review of the 42 most popular digital wellbeing apps available on the Google Play Store, a thematic analysis of more than 1,000 user reviews, and an in-the-wild study of a digital wellbeing app called Socialize. Results show that while contemporary digital wellbeing apps are well-received by users and useful for specific use cases, they are insufficient for effectively changing users' smartphone behavior. Promising areas for future exploration include designing digital wellbeing apps that support the formation of new habits and promote self-regulation through social support.
