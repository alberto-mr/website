<p>
On May 9, 2019, I presented the paper "Empowering End Users in Debugging Trigger-Action Rules" at ACM CHI 2019 (International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems), held in Glasgow, UK.
<br><br>
The paper presents EUDebug, a system that enables end users to debug trigger-action rules for personalizing Internet of Things (IoT) devices and services. With EUDebug, users compose rules in a web-based application similar to <a href = "https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a>. The system highlights potential problems that the complete set of defined rules may generate and allows for step-by-step simulation. Under the hood, a hybrid Semantic Colored Petri Net (SCPN) models, checks, and simulates trigger-action rules and their interactions. Results from an exploratory study with 15 end users show that EUDebug helps identify and understand problems in trigger-action rules that are not easily discoverable in existing platforms.
