Our paper "Coping with Digital Wellbeing in a Multi-Device World" has been accepted to <a href="https://chi2021.acm.org/">CHI 2021</a>!

<br><br>
The paper represents a first attempt to move the "digital wellbeing" topic toward a multi-device perspective. Despite growing interest in improving people's relationship with technology, researchers and media often approach digital wellbeing as a problem that characterizes single technological sources at a time, with particular focus on smartphones.

Through an analysis of 322 popular tools for digital self-control, background interviews, and co-design and sketching exercises with 20 users, the paper provides insights for better addressing digital wellbeing in a multi-device context. Findings highlight the importance of the underlying task and suggest the need for designing more integrated and adaptable tools capable of analyzing and making sense of data collected from a variety of sources. Furthermore, results call for digital wellbeing solutions that extend beyond technological tools, encompassing social, educational, and even political factors.
